# Development Environment

In this tutorial I used:

* Visual Studio Code 
* TypeScript and TypeScript Compiler v5.4.5
* Node.js v20.12.2

# Future Work

In the future I would like to:

- Improve user interface design for a more visually appealing note-taking experience.
- Implement search functionality to allow users to search for specific notes.
- Incorporate local storage or a database for persistent note storage across sessions.
- Explore additional TypeScript features and advanced concepts to further enhance the application's functionality and maintainability.
